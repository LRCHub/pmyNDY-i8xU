Our faces were forgotten, the unrecognized above
It's a mystery in this paradise
In a time we were abandoned to amaze the miserable
But that time has been forever lost

We have been reborn
We were the bruised, we were the broken
We don't have the pieces anymore
We have won, we have overcome
Our scars have been made beautiful
With everything, this is who we are

Our reflection's overtaken by the unexpectable
With the grace that takes the place of change
Crams on, keeps getting over, the most unforgivable
Stealing all our sense away

We have been reborn
We were the bruised, we were the broken
We don't have the pieces anymore
We have won, we have overcome
Our scars have been made beautiful
With everything, this is who we are

We are rising above this gravity
We have been reborn
We were the bruised, we were the broken
We don't have the pieces anymore

We have won, we have overcome
Our scars have been made beautiful
Our scars have been made beautiful
With everything, this is who we are
This is who we are, this is who we are
