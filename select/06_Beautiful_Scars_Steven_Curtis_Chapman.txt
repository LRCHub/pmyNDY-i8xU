Sit here with me
And tell me Your story
Even if it breaks my heart
Let me see Your scars

Shame will whisper
Oh but we can't listen
'Cause these are the stories
That make us who we are
And I love who You are and Your

Beautiful scars, Your beautiful scars
Reminders of the wounded love
That had carried us this far
Beautiful scars
Turning the marks of our pain
Into beautiful scars

For us, bruised and broken
For us, He was forsaken
Our wounded Healer
Suffered to set us free
See in His hands and His feet

Beautiful scars, beautiful scars
Reminders of the wounded love
That had carried us this far
Beautiful scars
Turning the marks of our pain
Into beautiful scars

See in His hands and His feet

Beautiful scars, beautiful scars
Reminders of the Savior's love
That had carried us this far
Beautiful scars
Turning the marks of our pain
Into beautiful scars

Oh, how I love Your beautiful scars
So beautiful, so beautiful
Beautiful scars
