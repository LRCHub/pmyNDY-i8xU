```lrc
[00:08.03] Broken all the pieces I've been shaping lately
[00:11.68] Focused on the things that didn't make no sense
[00:15.25] Guess that growing up was never meant to be easy
[00:39.25] 
[00:22.54] Yeah, I got used to doing everything sideways
[00:26.20] Didn't really care about how anyone felt
[00:29.79] Hiding my emotions down in different ashtrays
[00:52.29] 
[00:35.12] Oh, but what is lost ain't gone
[00:39.18] No, you can't just let go
[00:41.65] 'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
[00:46.52] Embrace your flaws
[00:55.52] 
[00:49.51] I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
[00:53.22] Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
[00:56.99] But I wouldn't change if I could restart
[01:00.57] I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
[01:03.95] I've been going way too hard on myself
[01:07.64] Guess that it is the reason I've been feeling like hell
[01:11.31] But I wouldn't change if I could restart
[01:14.95] I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
[01:34.95] 
[01:20.31] I went down a road that only got me nowhere
[01:23.88] I've seen every corner, every inch of this place
[01:27.56] Being all alone, it really got me thinking, maybe overthinking
[01:58.56] 
[01:33.48] That what is lost ain't gone
[01:37.04] No, you can't just let go
[01:39.68] 'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
[01:44.12] Embrace your flaws
[01:53.12] 
[01:47.45] I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
[01:51.06] Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
[01:54.61] But I wouldn't change if I could restart
[01:58.25] I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
[02:01.85] I've been going way too hard on myself
[02:05.53] Guess that it is the reason I've been feeling like hell
[02:09.08] But I wouldn't change if I could restart
[02:12.84] I ain't gonna hide these beautiful, hide these beautiful scars
[02:43.84] 
[02:22.59] Hide these beautiful scars
